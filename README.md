# **Project**

It’s been 10+ years now that FOSS@Amrita came into existence. We are a community of students who support and guide each other towards making open source contributions, which not only helps them to build their technical skills but also helps them to contribute back to the society. Being one of the most active student communities of the country, we have made our presence felt all over. We have been getting a lot of exposure & opportunities via different platforms such as conferences & social media to name a few.

**Idea / Goal of the club**: To be a better human being.
